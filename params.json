Website!!!\r\nHello There!! this Is were you can look up for the FAQ or want to know if there is an update coming!!\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\nHow do I search on GitHub search ?\r\nA: Click the magnify glass when you are down typing in the search box. There will be a future update that it will make searching easier.    \r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributorâ€™s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\nSupport or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Our Apps?
